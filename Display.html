        <p> The next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had 
           said. As best as I could tell, Mike and I were the only poor kids in this 
           school. Mike was also in this school by a twist of fate. Someone had 
           drawn a jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in 
           school with the rich kids.We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we  
           were because all the other boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles, 
           new everything.</p>
           
           <p>“So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked.
            “I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my partner?”
            He agreed, and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my 
           first business partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas 
           on how to make money. Occasionally we talked about all the “cool 
           guys” at Jimmy’s beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt 
           was good, because it inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make 
           money. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning struck. It was an 
           idea Mike got from a science book he had read. Excitedly, we shook 
           hands, and the partnership now had a business.</p>

           <p>Dad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of 
            the driveway since the production line blocked the carport. As he and 
            his friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals in 
            which the toothpaste tubes were being melted down. In those days, 
            toothpaste did not come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of 
            lead. So once the paint was burned off, the tubes were dropped in the 
            small steel pot.</p>

    <div class="d2">
        <p>My first partnership was already being threatened with an eviction 
            notice by my own mom! It became Mike’s job to tell the neighbors to 
            quickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist wanted them to 
            brush more often anyway. I began to put together the production line.
             One day my dad drove up with a friend to see two nine-year-old 
            boys in the driveway with a production line operating at full speed. 
            T
             here was fine white powder everywhere. On a long table were small 
            milk cartons from school, and our family’s hibachi grill was glowing 
            with red-hot coals at maximum heat.</p>

        <p>Mike and I met with his dad that morning at eight o’clock. He 
            was already busy, having been at work for more than an hour. His 
            construction supervisor was just leaving in his pickup truck as I walked 
            up to his simple, small, and tidy home. Mike met me at the door.
             “Dad’s on the phone, and he said to wait on the back porch,”  
            Mike said as he opened the door.
            The old wooden floor creaked as I stepped across the threshold of 
            the aging house. There was a cheap mat just inside the door. The mat 
            was there to hide the years of wear from countless footsteps that the 
            floor had supported.</p>

            <p>My rich dad continued my first lesson, “I’m glad you got angry 
                about working for 10 cents an hour. If you hadn’t got angry and had 
                simply accepted it, I would have to tell you that I could not teach you. 
                You see, true learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire. Anger 
                is a big part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined. 
                When it comes to money, most people want to play it safe and feel 
                secure. So passion does not direct them. Fear does.”</p>
